#### Scrum master: @Ivy7493

#### Project Goal
Develop product for the analysis of student C++ code for the purposes of finding bad coding practices:
~ Find global variables
~ Find use of the friend keyword
~ Find use of the Public Data Members
~ Find any uses of the switch case
~ Find any use of Implementation Inheritance
~ Find infringements of the DRY principle
~ Present findings to end user
~ Allow end user to upload/target specific source code or projects

#### Sprint goal
~ Create code parser
~ Create central plugin Hub for tools
~ Create Global variable tool
~ Create Friend Keyword tool
~ Create Public data member detection tool
~ Create switch case detection tool
~ Create Implementation Inheritance detection tool
~ Give the user feedback on their project and the issues found in it
	- This is done in the form of a short report that is generated

#### Duration of Sprint: 1 week

#### Moderation

~ The friend tool haven't been checked thoroughly
~ All tools should get test cases

#### Successes

~ Closed all issues
~ Team exceeded initial expectations by completing 5/6 tools in week 1 where only 1 tool, the file parser and an initial UI was expected from week 1
~ Team communicated very well with daily meetings
	- All team queries were adressed in a timely fashion
	- All team submissions were looked over by other members of the team
~ Team members delivered what was expected of them

#### Failures

~ There were merge conflicts that occured that could have been avoided 

#### Improvements

~ Issues should be better separated into branches according to trunk-based development
~ More labels should be assigned to issues to keep the workflow clean and understandible
